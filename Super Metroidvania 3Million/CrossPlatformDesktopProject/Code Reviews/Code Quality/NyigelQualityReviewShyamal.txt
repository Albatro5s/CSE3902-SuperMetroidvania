============================================================

Coupling: Low
Comments: The class has few dependencies and doesn't rely on too much info directly from other classes.

Cohesion: Medium
Comments: All of the state variables and methods are related to the player, but this class covers an extremely large range of player functionality and info.

Maintainability: Good
Comments: The player class has a lot of potential for supporting additional features going forward.

List any "code smells":
1) Textures are taken from specific positions in a list. Seems odd.
2) A lot of state information is stored here in many different variables. Could probably be separated into another class or various collections.

A hypothetical change to make to the game related to file being reviewed and how the current implementation could or could not easily support that change:
Support for an additional player character (CO-OP). Using two separate instances of this class, 
however, one instance would probably be the "lead" character who determines the side scrolling.
