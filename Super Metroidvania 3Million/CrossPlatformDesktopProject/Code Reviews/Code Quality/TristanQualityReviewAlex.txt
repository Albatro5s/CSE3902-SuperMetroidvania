============================================================

Coupling: Low
Comments: Keep class simple and uses very few parameters outside of global variables. Doesn't rely much on other classes

Cohesion: High
Comments: Everything is done within the class and most methods are passed few variables, making the class very cohesive.

Maintainability: Good
Comments: Methods provide plenty of room and flexability for future additions and other maintenance. 

List any "code smells":
1) Empty methods present
2) Minimal documentation
...

A hypothetical change to make to the game related to file being reviewed and how the current implementation could or could not easily support that change:
Usable items will be implemented as a pretty key feature in the game, so the method will likely change once we determine the application/use of each of the items.
