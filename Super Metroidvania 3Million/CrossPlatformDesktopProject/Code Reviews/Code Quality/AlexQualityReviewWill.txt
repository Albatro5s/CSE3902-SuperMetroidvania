============================================================

Coupling: Loose
Comments: Methods in the class don't really rely on info from other classes.

Cohesion: High
Comments: Most of the methods are passed a variable and completes the method locally.

Maintainability: Good
Comments: The class has room for easy future maintanance and adaptability. Methods are also failry short making them easier to read and resuse.

List any "code smells":
1) The specific numbering in the update method

If the screen size were to change to a smaller window, the current update could possibly have the Skree of the screen for too long. The number for at
it resets to its initial position would need to be adjusted
