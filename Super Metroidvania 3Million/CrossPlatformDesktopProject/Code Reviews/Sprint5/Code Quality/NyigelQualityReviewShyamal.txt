============================================================

Coupling: Medium
Comments: Has a lot of public properties being set elsewhere.

Cohesion: Low
Comments: The player seems to have a lot of info about the states such as offset values. This class is responsible for all of the different upgrade functionality.

Maintainability: Low-Medium
Comments: Lots and lots of magic numbers, low cohesion, and a lot of additional public methods apart from the interface being implemented will make it hard to maintain this class.

List any "code smells":
1) Many variables seem to represent similar concepts
2) A lot of booleans and checks that probably could be factored away elsewhere

A hypothetical change to make to the game related to file being reviewed and how the current implementation could or could not easily support that change:
Adding Co-op or another player variant would be very difficult with all of the additional methods and properties in the Samus class compared to the IPlayer interface.
