============================================================

Coupling: Low
Comments: Does not need to know about or depend on anything else 

Cohesion: High
Comments: The class is used only to draw the map

Maintainability: medium
Comments: Draw method could be difficult to maintain due to magic numbers but overall not bad

List any "code smells":
1) IsDead method always returns false, could consider removing that
2) Magic numbers are present in Draw method

A hypothetical change to make to the game related to file being reviewed and how the current implementation could or could not easily support that change:
Changing the size of the map sprite would require tweaking magic numbers to fit the new map size, could make it more difficult to change the size of the sprite
