============================================================

Coupling: Low
Comments: Needs to know about GameObjectContainer singleton but nothing else 

Cohesion: High
Comments: The class is used only to generate block objects. It contains a switch case used to determine the appropriate block.

Maintainability: high
Comments: Only one switch-case to maintain, removing and adding blocks is easy and straightforard

List any "code smells":
1) very long switch-case statement

A hypothetical change to make to the game related to file being reviewed and how the current implementation could or could not easily support that change:
Adding a new block to the game can easily be implemented by adding another case to the switch-case structure with the name of the new block. Similarly, removing a block is as easy as deleting it's case from the swich-case.
