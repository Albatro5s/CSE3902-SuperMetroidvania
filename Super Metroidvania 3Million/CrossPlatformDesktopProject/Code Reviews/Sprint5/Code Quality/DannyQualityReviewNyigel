============================================================

Coupling: Low
Comments: Doesn't really need to know anything from other classes, instead is an abstract class extended by other classes to implement menus 

Cohesion: High
Comments: Class only focuses on buttons pressed to control the menu

Maintainability: high
Comments: Simple direction controls for menu, straightforward use for the class 

List any "code smells":
1) A couple magic numbers
