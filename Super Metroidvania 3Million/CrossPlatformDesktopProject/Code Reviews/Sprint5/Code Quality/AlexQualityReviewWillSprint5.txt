Coupling: Low
Comments: Almost all code is dealt with locally without calling upon another class.

Cohesion: Tight
Comments: Most/all variables and methods are passed/dealt with locally.

Maintainability: Good
Comments: Code can be easily change for future purposes and the variables that are called also easily changable.

List any "code smells":
N/A

A hypothetical change to make to the game related to file being reviewed and how the current implementation could or could not easily support that change:
If there were new enemies were to be added to the game, it could be easily implemented with adding them to the endless level with editing too much from other 
classes.
