============================================================

Coupling: Medium
Comments: Most of the methods don't require too much code from other classes other than for getting frames of the sprites.

Cohesion: High
Comments: Most/all variables and methods are passed locally and the ones that do call another class are just to prevent magic numbers.

Maintainability: Good
Comments: Code can be easily change for future purposes and the variables that are called also easily changable.

List any "code smells":
N/A

A hypothetical change to make to the game related to file being reviewed and how the current implementation could or could not easily support that change:
If the enemy were to gain a new state this could be easily implemented for the sprite by adding another method and then also editing another class as well.
