============================================================

Coupling: Low
Comments: Does not really rely on much outside of the class.

Cohesion: Medium
Comments: The class only focuses on the player but covers many aspects such as hitbox, movements, attacks, etc. 

Maintainability: Medium
Comments: Magic numbers are everywhere and it would be challenging to make changes to those  

List any "code smells":
1) Magic numbers are still present

A hypothetical change to make to the game related to file being reviewed and how the current implementation could or could not easily support that change:
Changing the siez of the Samus sprite would be very difficult to implement because the height and width of the sprite would have to be changed in multiple places.
