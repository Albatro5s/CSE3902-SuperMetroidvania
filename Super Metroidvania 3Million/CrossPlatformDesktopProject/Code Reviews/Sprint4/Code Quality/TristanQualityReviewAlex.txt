============================================================

Coupling: Low
Comments: Class kept simple, very few parameters outside global variables. Is used outside of the class, doesn't rely on many other classes besides sprite drawing.

Cohesion: High
Comments: Everything is done within the class, methods are passed few variables making the class very cohesive - additionally, previous classes have been condensed into these classes by a significant factor

Maintainability: Excellent
Comments: Methods provide flexability for future additions and methods. Very intuitive to update. 

List any "code smells":
1) Minimal documentation, if necessary (?)
...

No further suggestions on my part.
