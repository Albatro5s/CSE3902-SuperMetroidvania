Sprint Reflection:

Overall we performed well on this Sprint. All of the features that were required to be included 
in the game were added. We started by coding each individual class and interface such as the
game class, the sprite interface, the player interface, etc... We quickly realized that this
was not a good strategy because all of these needed to be continuously updated as the project
was developed. As a result, for the next Sprint, we will work on the code in different portions
as opposed to trying to spread out the coding. Also, we were a little lax with our preset
deadlines and for the next Sprint we will follow them more closely.
