======================================================

Specific comments on what is readable and what is not:
1) Lots of instance variables but they are all necessary and are grouped well to improve readability 
2) LoadAllTextures is similar to the instance variables, very long but grouped well
3) Other methods in the class have descriptive names and it is clear what they do
4) Very few comments, could use a bit more in some areas.
