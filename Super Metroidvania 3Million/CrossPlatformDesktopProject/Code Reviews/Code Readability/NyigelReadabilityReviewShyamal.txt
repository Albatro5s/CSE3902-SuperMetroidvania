======================================================

Specific comments on what is readable and what is not:
1) The instance variables are self explanatory/named intiutively.
2) The constructor is simple as it just assigns instance variables.
3) The Execute method has some vagueness as to why there is a different call to UpdateState if samus.jumpFrames == 10.
