============================================================

Coupling: Low
Comments: The class doesn't rely on too much information from other classes, other than game, factory, and player but this is necessary to a create the bomb

Cohesion: High
Comments: This class is used to execute the creation of a bomb sprite in factory based on a key that was pressed

Maintainability: Good
Comments: Class is very simple and methods are short an easy to use, will be easy to reuse in the future

List any "code smells":
1) Seems a bit odd that a call to a factory method is present

A hypothetical change to make to the game related to file being reviewed and how the current implementation could or could not easily support that change:
A method to create a bomb sprite could be included in the game class and called by Execute, but this would sort of be repetitive
