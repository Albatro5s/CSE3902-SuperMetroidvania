======================================================

Specific comments on what is readable and what is not:
1) The constructor is pretty straight forward. Includes some magic numbers that are vague.
2) CycleBeamMissile() uses the missile variable which should really be an enum or something more descriptive.
3) All other methods are pretty straightforward, using state information to determine the logic.
