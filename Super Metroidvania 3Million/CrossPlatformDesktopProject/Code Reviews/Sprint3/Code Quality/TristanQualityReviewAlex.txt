============================================================

Coupling: Low
Comments: Keep class simple and uses very few parameters outside of global variables. Is used outside of the class, but doesn't rely on many other classes besides sprite drawing.

Cohesion: High
Comments: Everything is done within the class and most methods are passed few variables, making the class very cohesive - additionally, previous variables have been condensed

Maintainability: Good
Comments: Methods provide plenty of room and flexability for future additions and additional methods. 

List any "code smells":
1) Minimal documentation
2) Currently having minor loading issues, but this is something that will likely be resolved with collisions/mapping
...

A hypothetical change to make to the game related to file being reviewed and how the current implementation could or could not easily support that change:
Usable items aren't completely implemented yet in their interaction with the player, but this will likely be done through the player class.
