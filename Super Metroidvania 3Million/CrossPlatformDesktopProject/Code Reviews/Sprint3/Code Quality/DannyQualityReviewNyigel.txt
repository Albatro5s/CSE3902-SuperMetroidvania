============================================================

Coupling: Medium
Comments: Class only relies on information from other classes that is neccessary for the for the function of GameObjectContainer, such as projectileList, blockList, etc.

Cohesion: High
Comments: Class is used to contain and update all Game Object lists, and methods are simple and effective 

Maintainability: Good
Comments: Class is very simple and it is easy to add objects to the GameObjectContainer, which will then be used to perform updates and draws on all game objects. Very easy to add
new objects and update types of objects that can be added in the future 

List any "code smells":

All lists of object types could be combined into a list of lists to reduce code, but this make things more complicated
