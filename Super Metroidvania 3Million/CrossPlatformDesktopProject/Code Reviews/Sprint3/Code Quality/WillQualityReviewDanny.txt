============================================================

Coupling: Low
Comments: Needs to know about ContentManager but nothing else 

Cohesion: High
Comments: The class is used to create block sprites and each method returns a new block sprite or list of block sprites.

Maintainability: Medium
Comments: very high number of methods and would be a huge pain to modify each one if necessary, but each method is short and not complex and accomplishes a very specific task

List any "code smells":
1) very high number of methods

A hypothetical change to make to the game related to file being reviewed and how the current implementation could or could not easily support that change:
Adding or removing specific blocks to the game would be handled by this file and it would be easy to add another texture and method to return the new block or remove a texture and method for an unused block.
