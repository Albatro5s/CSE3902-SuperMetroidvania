============================================================

Coupling: Medium
Comments: All private fields. Coupled a lot with the Samus class accessing its public variables directly. 

Cohesion: High
Comments: Pretty much only the logic associated with this state and transferring to other states. 

Maintainability: High
Comments: Using the state pattern makes this state specifically easy to change.

List any "code smells":
1) Accesses samus public vars directly
2) samus.missile is not too descriptive and compared to a magic number

A hypothetical change to make to the game related to file being reviewed and how the current implementation could or could not easily support that change:
Add another beam weapon. Add another if-case in the Attack() method.
