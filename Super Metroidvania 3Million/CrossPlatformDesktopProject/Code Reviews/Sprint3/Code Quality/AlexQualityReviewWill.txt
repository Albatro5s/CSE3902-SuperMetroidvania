============================================================

Coupling: Medium
Comments: Most methods in class are done locally but a few of them rely on another class for movement.

Cohesion: Medium
Comments: Most methods are are passed variable locally and are completed within this class.

Maintainability: Good
Comments: Methods are simple to edit and have the potential to be refactored easily if need be.

List any "code smells":
N/A

A hypothetical change to make to the game related to file being reviewed and how the current implementation could or could not easily support that change:
There could be a new movement style that is mor dynamic like moving diagonally or something similar. This could be  implementented bying adding another method 
the state machine could make.
