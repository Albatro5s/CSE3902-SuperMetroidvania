**PLAYER UPGRADES**

* Long Beam : Lengthens the attacking range of the beam weapon. Also increases damage.
* Ice Beam : This allows you to freeze an enemy temporarily. If you already have a long beam, then the ice beam becomes a long beam. This can't be used at the same time as the wave beam.
* Wave Beam : The beams are wave-shaped and are stronger than normal beams. If you already have a long beam, the long beam becomes a long wave beam.
* Screw Attack : This super strong Power Item spins in flight to attack the enemy. Samus's armor flashes during a screw attack.
 * Varia : This raises Samus's powers of resistance and cuts in half the amount of energy he uses up when attacked by an enemy.
 * Maru Mari : Samus grows small and round like a ball when he gets this Power Item. Useful when travelling along narrow passageways.
 * Bomb : Samus can use the bomb when he is still small and round. Drop bombs to damage enemies or blast through barriers.
 * Energy Tank : Energy is stored in these tanks. Normally, the amount of storable energy cannot go above 99, but with each tank it grows by 100. You can collect as many as 6.
 * Missile Rocket : This stores the missiles. If you capture one, you get 5 more missiles. Collect missiles from defeated enemies. You can store a maximum of 255.
